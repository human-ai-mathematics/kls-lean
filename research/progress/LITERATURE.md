# KLS literature and local formalization

[Progress hub](README.md) · [Current proof routes](README.md#proof-progress-tree) · [Node register](STATUS.md)

**Literature through July 2026 · Sources checked 2026-09-16 · 27 selected sources.**

Selected foundational sources, the main general KLS bound milestones, and the connected moment-map, slicing and thin-shell developments through July 2026; not an exhaustive bibliography or a paper-by-paper proof verification.

The literature has advanced to an inverse-Cheeger bound of order `(log n)^(1/4)` in the
[July 2026 Letwin preprint](https://arxiv.org/html/2607.24164v1). Our repository currently
formalizes selected analytic foundations and reductions; none of the general
dimension-dependent frontier bounds below is yet proved here. Dimension-free KLS remains open.

Publication status and local Lean status are separate columns. **◐ means named fragments or
restricted counterparts, never an entire paper; ○ means the selected main result is not
locally formalized.** A ✓ beside an individual local result is derived from the existing
Blueprint/progress records. It is not a new certificate or a certification of the source paper.

## Constant conventions

For isotropic log-concave laws, use `Var(f) ≤ C_P ∫‖∇f‖² dμ`, with no factor 1/2.
Write `h` for the Cheeger lower-bound constant with denominator `min(μ(A), 1−μ(A))`,
and `ψ = 1/h`, `ψₙ = sup_μ ψ(μ)` for the inverse convention. Some older papers use the
symbol ψ for h instead; their bounds are translated here. The original KLS paper also
uses a product denominator, so exact numerical constants cannot be copied unchanged.

The literature comparison is `ψ²/π ≤ C_P ≤ 4ψ²`; consequently `ψₙ = O((log n)^a)`
corresponds to `C_P = O((log n)^(2a))`. See [Letwin, introduction](https://arxiv.org/html/2607.24164v1#S1)
and [De Ponti–Mondino](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03835). This full comparison is still
an open local Lean task. Logarithmic bounds below use `n ≥ 2` (Guan’s iterated-log bound uses `n ≥ 3`).

## Literature map

Every node links to its source. Dashed arrows show later milestones or related methods,
**not logical implications, complete dependency lists, or Lean proof edges**. Blue is
literature context; amber highlights July 2026. Neither color means formalized.

The older dates in the KLS chain refer to first circulation/conference presentation;
the tables distinguish those dates from final journal publication. Slicing and thin shell
are separate achievements; their resolution does not give dimension-free KLS.

## What the July papers would require here

Both July results need a local moment-measure construction and its regularity theory.
The sharp thin-shell paper then needs the weighted Hessian identities and third-order
tensor estimates. The quadratic-form paper additionally needs its matrix inequality,
Stein/H⁻¹ argument and the conversion through the directional third-moment parameter.
These are missing mathematical developments, despite our existing density, closed-form
and Euclidean calculus infrastructure. The existing CMH and spectral route propositions
are conditional research routes and do not certify either paper.

## Source and coverage notes

- July statements are pinned to `2607.23307v1` and `2607.24164v1`. Both are preprints;
  this map checks bibliographic data, main statements and normalization, not every proof step.
- The 2025 parallel-coupling preprint is read at `2507.15495v2` (23 February 2026).
- The book’s coefficient 4 is a recorded statement; our one-dimensional proof is independent.
  The original attribution remains distinct from mathematical proof and formal verification:
  see the [source audit](../explorations/2026-09-11-poincare-constant-4-audit.md).
  Book metadata was checked on the publisher pages; detailed book-page correspondences
  use the existing source audits, rather than a fresh reading of the complete monographs.
- General auxiliary progress, such as locally Lipschitz coarea and smooth recovery, is listed
  in the [proof route map](README.md#proof-progress-tree); it is not automatically credited
  as a completed fragment of every paper that could use it.
- No percentage of a paper is reported: result counts do not measure proof coverage.
