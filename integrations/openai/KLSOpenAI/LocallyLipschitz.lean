# The KLS density bound for locally Lipschitz L2 tests

Bizeul–Klartag–Lehec, arXiv:2610.05474v1, Theorem 1.1, tests locally Lipschitz
functions in L2. This frontend retains the pinned OpenAI model's density and
coordinate-isotropy assumptions and enlarges its test class to that of the paper.
The gradient energy is an extended nonnegative integral, including infinity.
The original OpenAI model and its smooth compactly supported statement are unchanged.

The bridge is conditional on `FunctionalInequalities.KLS.Conjecture`; this module
does not import a proof of KLS. The closed endpoint is in `KLSOpenAI.Target`.

/-- The Euclidean carrier of the OpenAI model is complete.

`gradient` takes this instance as an argument. Left to instance synthesis, its proof is a
compound term that Lean abstracts into a generated auxiliary theorem whose name depends on
the surrounding module, so the same source can elaborate to different terms in the Palomar
challenge and in its solution. `LocallyLipschitzBound` names this theorem instead. It is not
an instance. -/

/-- The direct Poincare bound on the paper's locally Lipschitz L2 test class.
The variance is the ordinary centered-square integral. Its nonnegative extended
value is compared with the squared-gradient energy, which may be infinite. -/

bounds the extended variance of every locally Lipschitz function by its squared-gradient
