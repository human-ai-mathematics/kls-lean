# Topological support under pushforward, restriction and density

For an open-positive measure: the support of a continuous pushforward is the closure of the range; restriction to a closed
set equal to the closure of its interior (in particular a closed convex set with nonempty interior) has that set as support;
an a.e. nonzero density preserves the support, so `1_K e^{−W} μ` has support `K`.
