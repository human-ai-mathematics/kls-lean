# Intrinsic affine coordinates of a finite-dimensional probability measure

For a probability measure on a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space, this module takes the
affine span of its topological support and expresses the law on the direction of that affine
subspace. The resulting coordinate space is again a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space.

The construction removes directions normal to the affine support. It does not claim that an
ambient gradient pre-energy is closable for every singular law inside that support; atomic and
lower-dimensional non-affine singularities still require relaxation or a separate core theorem.
