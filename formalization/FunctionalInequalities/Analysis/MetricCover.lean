# Buffered countable ball covers of open sets

Positive contained closed balls are chosen at actual points of an open set.
A countable subfamily of the half-radius open balls covers that set. This is
metric localization only: no convexity, measure, finite dimension, compactness
or nonemptiness hypothesis. The two consumers are local contact null images
and compact-patch localization of domain Monge–Ampere equations for Letwin

/-- An open set in a second-countable pseudometric space has a countable cover
by half-radius balls whose full closed balls lie in the set. Centers are actual
points of the open set, including when it is empty. -/
