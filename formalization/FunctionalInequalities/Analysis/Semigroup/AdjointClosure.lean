# Weak identities pass to the closure, and into the adjoint

Let `T : H₀ →ₗ.[ℝ] H₁` be a closable operator between real Hilbert spaces. If two fixed vectors
`w : H₀` and `v : H₁` satisfy the weak identity `⟪w, x⟫ = ⟪v, T x⟫` for every `x ∈ D(T)`, the same
identity holds for every `x ∈ D(T̄)` with `T̄ x` in place of `T x`: the set of pairs `(x, y)` with
`⟪w, x⟫ = ⟪v, y⟫` is closed and contains the graph of `T`, hence its closure, which is the graph
of `T̄` (`LinearPMap.IsClosable.graph_closure_eq_closure_graph`).

Consequently `v ∈ D(T̄†)` and, when `D(T̄)` is dense, `T̄† v = w`
(`LinearPMap.mem_adjoint_domain_of_exists`, `LinearPMap.adjoint_apply_eq`). Combined with
`adjointComp` this is the tool that puts a vector `x ∈ D(T̄)` into `D(T̄†T̄)` and computes
`T̄†T̄ x` from a weak identity verified on the unclosed domain only.

The module also records two witness-level tools: `apply_sub_of_eq_sub`, which evaluates `S` on a
difference with the three membership witnesses supplied separately, and the graph-limit tool
`exists_mem_domain_apply_eq_of_tendsto`: a
**closed** operator absorbs limits of its graph points, so a vector reached by `x n ∈ D(S)` with
`S (x n)` convergent lies in `D(S)`, with the expected value. Together with a Cauchy estimate this
is how an identity or bound proved on a smaller domain is transported to the closure.

Pure Hilbert-space material: no measure, no differential operator, no semigroup.

/-- A closed operator absorbs graph limits: if `x n ∈ D(S)` for every `n`, `x n → a` in `H₀` and
`S (x n) → b` in `H₁`, then `a ∈ D(S)` and `S a = b`.

`LinearPMap.IsClosed` is closedness of the graph as a subset of `H₀ × H₁`, so this is
`IsClosed.mem_of_tendsto` applied to the pair sequence, followed by `LinearPMap.mem_graph_iff`
and proof irrelevance of the membership witness. Completeness is not used: the limits are
hypotheses. -/
