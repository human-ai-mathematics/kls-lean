# The Yosida approximation `L_s = s⁻¹ (1 - J_s)`

Definitions only. Given a closed operator `T : H₀ →ₗ.[ℝ] H₁` between real Hilbert spaces and the
resolvent `J_s = resolventCLM T hT hs` of `Analysis/Semigroup/Resolvent/Basic.lean`, this module
packages
the bounded operator `L_s = s⁻¹ • (1 - J_s)` on `H₀`. Formally `L_s = T†T J_s = T†T (1 + s T†T)⁻¹`,
the classical Yosida approximation of `T†T`; that identification is the resolvent defect identity of
`Analysis/Semigroup/VonNeumann.lean`, not anything proved here.

Its properties (nonnegativity, symmetry, commutation, convergence to `T†T` on `D(T†T)`, and the
strong convergence of `exp (-t • L_s)` which is the adjoint-product identification) are proved in
`Yosida/Laws.lean` and `Yosida/Limit.lean`. Everything here is definitional or `simp`-level
glue. No measure, no log-concavity and no KLS content.
