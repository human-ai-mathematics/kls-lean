# The form domain of a closed operator, and the weak resolvent equation

The first steps of the construction of the heat semigroup
used by the Buser half of `thm:logconcave-cheeger-poincare-comparison`.

For a densely defined operator `T : H₀ →ₗ.[ℝ] H₁` the energy form is `E(u) = ‖T u‖²`, unbounded on
`H₀` but bounded on the form domain `D(T)` in the graph norm. This module supplies the three
statements that make the Lax–Milgram construction of the resolvent applicable:

* `completeSpace_graph` (the form construction): the graph of a closed operator is complete, which is the
  completeness the form domain needs;
* `min_one_mul_graphNormSq_le` (the shifted weak form): the shifted form `⟪u, v⟫ + s ⟪T u, T v⟫` is coercive in the
  graph norm, with explicit constant `min 1 s`;
* `norm_le_of_weak_resolvent` and `inner_nonneg_of_weak_resolvent` (the resolvent operator): any solution of the weak
  resolvent equation is a contraction of the datum and pairs nonnegatively with it.

Nothing here constructs the resolvent, the Yosida approximation or the semigroup; those are resolvent solvability,
the Yosida approximation and the semigroup limit, and are not proved. This module is general real Hilbert space material: it
mentions no measure, no log-concavity and no KLS quantity.

/-- the form construction: the graph of a closed operator is a complete space.

`LinearPMap.IsClosed` is by definition closedness of the graph as a set, so this is the closed
subspace of the complete product `H₀ × H₁`. It is the completeness that makes the form domain
`D(T)`, carrying the inner product `⟪u, v⟫ + ⟪T u, T v⟫`, a Hilbert space. -/

/-- the shifted weak form: coercivity of the shifted form in the graph norm.

The quadratic form `u ↦ ‖u‖² + s ‖T u‖²` dominates `min 1 s` times the squared graph norm. This is
the coercivity hypothesis that `IsCoercive` asks for, with an explicit constant.

Positivity of `s` is not needed and is therefore not assumed: for
`s ≤ 1` the claim reduces to `(s - 1) ‖u‖² ≤ 0` and for `s > 1` to `‖T u‖² ≤ s ‖T u‖²`. Neither
closedness nor density is used either. -/
