# Boundary maxima of convex functions

A continuous convex function on the closure of a bounded open convex domain
is bounded above by any upper bound on its frontier. This pure real-normed
statement supplies the upper boundary control for Alexandrov Dirichlet
approximation (Gutierrez 2001, Section 1.6); it uses no Monge–Ampere equation
or differentiability. The maximum statement requires positive dimension.

The actual interior strong-maximum rigidity is shared with UNIT Dirichlet
negativity. That pure rigidity requires only a real normed space and an actual
interior maximum; the frontier bound retains its finite-dimensional scope.

For an open convex set, an open ball in its closure contains every smaller closed ball in the set
itself. This normed-space interior step is shared by the affine-normalized section estimates.
