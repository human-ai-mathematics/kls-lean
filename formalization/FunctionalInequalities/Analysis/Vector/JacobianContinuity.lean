/-! # Continuity and measurability of the volume factors

Mathlib proves the algebraic theory of
`LinearMap.normDet` but **not** its continuity in the operator, so the right-hand side of the area
formula is not yet known to be an integral of a measurable function.  This module supplies that.

`normDet A` is the square root of the determinant of the Gram operator `Aᵀ A`, and each step of
that description is continuous: the adjoint is a linear isometry, composition is continuous, the
determinant of a continuous linear endomorphism is continuous, and so is the square root.  The
measurability of the integrand then follows from `measurable_fderiv`, which needs **no**
differentiability hypothesis on the function.

The same argument applies verbatim to `coareaJacobian`, whose integrand the codimension-`m` coarea
formula will need on the other side.

**No area formula and no coarea formula are proved here.**
