# Classical derivatives from continuous a.e. derivatives

A Lipschitz map between finite-dimensional real inner product spaces whose a.e. derivative agrees
a.e. with a continuous
field is differentiable everywhere with that derivative, hence `C¹`. The proof mollifies by
shrinking bumps
(`hasFDerivAt_convolution_normed_of_lipschitz`) and passes to the locally uniform limit of the
derivatives.

A Lipschitz map whose derivative (which exists a.e.) agrees a.e. with a continuous field `B` is
differentiable
everywhere with derivative `B`, hence `C¹`. Proof: shrinking bump mollifications converge pointwise,
their derivatives are
the mollified `B` (`hasFDerivAt_convolution_normed_of_lipschitz`), which converge locally uniformly,
and the locally uniform
derivative-limit theorem applies. -/
