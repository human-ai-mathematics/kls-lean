# Integration against the surface measure of a `C¹` graph

The codimension-one area formula of `Analysis/Graph/Area.lean` is an identity of *measures of
sets*: `ℋ^k (Ψ '' s) = ∫_s √(1 + ‖∇g‖²)` for every measurable parameter set `s`.  That is not by
itself a change of variables for an arbitrary integrand.  This module supplies the minimal
interface the boundary flux needs, and nothing more: it is not a general area or manifold
integration library.

`map_graphChartMap_withDensity` upgrades the area formula to the identity of measures

  `map Ψ ((volume.withDensity √(1 + ‖∇g‖²)).restrict s) = ℋ^k ⌊ (Ψ '' s)`,

using injectivity of the graph parametrization (`graphChartMap_injective_of_perp`) and
measurability of its image (`measurableSet_image_graphChartMap`).  From it,
`setLIntegral_image_graphChartMap` and `setIntegral_image_graphChartMap` state the change of
variables for a nonnegative measurable integrand and for an almost everywhere strongly measurable
Banach-valued integrand:

  `∫_{Ψ '' s} f dℋ^k = ∫_s √(1 + ‖∇g y‖²) • f (Ψ y) dy`.

No integrability hypothesis appears: `integral_map` and `integral_withDensity_eq_integral_smul`
hold verbatim, both sides being zero when the integrand is not integrable.  Combined with the
normal formula `ν (Ψ y) = (ι (-∇g y) + e)/√(1 + ‖∇g y‖²)` of a boundary chart, the Jacobian
`√(1 + ‖∇g y‖²)` cancels exactly against the denominator of the unit normal; that cancellation is
carried out in `KLS/Geometry/SmoothDomain/LocalGaussGreen.lean`.

Every statement here is proved and uses only the standard axioms; the module contains no hole.
