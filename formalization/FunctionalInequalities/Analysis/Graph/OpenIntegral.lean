/-! # Weighted graph area over an open parameter domain

Property open-domain graph area of the weighted coarea route: the weighted change of variables
`setLIntegral_image_graphChartMap` of `Analysis/Graph/Integral.lean` requires the graph function to
be `C¹` on the **whole** parameter space.  Here it is localized to a function that is `C¹` only on
an open set `O`, for measurable parameter sets `S ⊆ O`.

A `ContDiffOn` function on an open set does **not** extend to a globally `C¹` function — `1 / x`
on `(0, ∞)` is the standard counterexample — so the localization is genuinely countable and cannot
be done by one global extension.  What is true, and is what `exists_contDiff_eqOn_ball` proves,
is that every point of `O` has a ball on which some globally `C¹` function agrees with the given
one: multiply by a `ContDiffBump` supported inside `O`.  This is the interior localization the route
prescribes; it is **not** the Whitney extension from a closed set, which is the separate unproved
obligation compact Whitney extension.

Second countability then extracts a countable subfamily of such balls covering `O`, `disjointed`
turns it into countably many pairwise disjoint measurable pieces of `S`, and the graph map is
injective (`graphMap_injective`), so the images of the pieces are disjoint and measurable.  Both
sides of the identity are countably additive over those pieces, and on each piece the global
theorem applies to the local extension; the gradients agree because the functions agree on an
**open** ball around each point (`Filter.EventuallyEq.gradient_eq`).

`Analysis/LocalExtension.lean` supplies the shared finite-order and smooth bump
extension; this module uses its explicit agreement ball.

No integrability, boundedness or finiteness hypothesis is used; the weight may be unbounded or
identically `∞`, `S` need not be bounded or of finite measure, and `O = ∅` or `S = ∅` are covered.
