/-! # The equidimensional degenerate case: almost no level is a critical value

When `n = m` the fibre dimension is `k = 0`, and `μH[0]`-nullity
of a slice means the slice is **empty**, so the statement to prove is that for almost every `t` the
level `{u = t}` contains **no** critical point at all.

**Proof.** The argument uses Mathlib's equidimensional Sard lemma
`MeasureTheory.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_det_fderivWithin_eq_zero` — if a map of a finite-dimensional
real space to *itself* is differentiable on a set and its differential is singular there, the image
of that set is Lebesgue-null — transported across the linear isometry
`isometryEquivOfFinrankEq` between two inner product spaces of the same dimension, plus the
linear algebra that in equal dimensions "not surjective" and "determinant zero" agree.

**Scope.** No general finite-regularity Sard theorem such as `Analysis.sard` is proved here. Sard's theorem is a statement about the
measure of the set of critical **values** of a map `ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ`; what is proved here is only the
`n = m` case, and only that case, where the critical set maps into a null set purely because a
singular linear map contracts volume.  For `n > m` the critical values of a `C¹` map can have
positive measure (Whitney), and nothing below says otherwise.  The rank-deficient coarea conclusion is a statement about `ℋ^k` **inside** a level and was proved independently in
`Analysis/Vector/RankDeficient/Coarea.lean`; this equidimensional theorem is a consistency check on it, not an ingredient of its proof.

**Relation to rank-deficient coarea.**  In the equidimensional case the coarea conclusion reads `μH[0] (C ∩ {u = t}) = 0` for almost
every `t`, and a nonempty set has `μH[0] ≥ 1`, so the two conclusions are then *equivalent* statements.
Nothing of that equivalence is used here: this module imports neither the rank-deficient coarea module nor any part of that route, so the two proofs are independent and the agreement is a real cross-check.
It is recorded in `research/audits/Sard/EquidimensionalAudit.lean`, in both directions.

/-- A non-surjective endomorphism of a finite-dimensional space has vanishing determinant.  Mathlib
has the converse direction (`LinearMap.range_lt_top_of_det_eq_zero`); this one goes through
injectivity, which is equivalent to surjectivity only in finite dimension. -/
