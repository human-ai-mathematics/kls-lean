# Sequential cores and recovery sequences

This module states exactly how a concrete finite pre-energy may generate an extended ambient
energy. The definitions deliberately separate four claims that are often conflated:

* constancy of the concrete energy on fibers of the ambient realization;
* agreement on the concrete tests;
* equality with the sequential relaxation;
* existence of a recovery sequence whose energies converge.

No density or Sobolev-core theorem is inferred merely from smoothness of the tests.

/-- A recovery sequence at `x` converges to `x` in the ambient topology and has energies
converging to the prescribed extended value. -/

/-- The concrete energy is constant on fibers of the realization map.

This is necessary before a pre-energy on concrete functions can be the literal restriction of an
energy on an `L²` quotient. It can fail for ambient gradients under a singular measure.

/-- A sequential form core both restricts the ambient energy correctly and generates it by
relaxation.

This project-specific name records the two exact equalities above. Identifying it with another
literature notion of graph-norm core is a theorem to be proved in the relevant analytic setting.
