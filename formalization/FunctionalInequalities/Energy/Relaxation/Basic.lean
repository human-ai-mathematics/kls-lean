# Sequential relaxation of a finite pre-energy

A `PreEnergy` records a concrete test class, its realization in a topological space, and a
finite nonnegative energy on those tests. Its sequential relaxation at `x` is the infimum of
the energy `liminf` over all test sequences converging to `x`.

The definition is intentionally sequential. The intended applications use real `L²`, hence a
metrizable topology; identifying it with an abstract lower-semicontinuous envelope is a later
theorem, not part of this definition.

/-- A continuous map with energy-nonincreasing lifts on concrete tests has the same bound
after relaxation. Neither test class needs to be nonempty or densely realized.

Each source test must have one target test realizing its image exactly. For comparison by
approximating sequences in a common pseudometric space, see
`PreEnergy.sequentialRelaxation_le_of_recovery_sequences` in
`FunctionalInequalities.Energy.Relaxation.LowerSemicontinuous`. The present result only needs
topological ambient spaces and also allows a map between different spaces.

/-- Scaled comparison of relaxations along a continuous map: if every concrete test of `P` is
matched by a test of `Q` with the mapped realization and energy at most `κ` times as large, the
relaxations compare with the same finite factor at every point of finite `P`-relaxation. The
finiteness premise excludes `κ = 0` against an empty approximating class. -/
