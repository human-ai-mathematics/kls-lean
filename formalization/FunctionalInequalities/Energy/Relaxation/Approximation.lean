# Choosing concrete tests for sequential relaxation

Two elementary approximation steps are shared by the lower-semicontinuity and recovery proofs.
`exists_test_near_of_relaxation_lt` selects one test close to a prescribed point, with energy
below any strict upper bound for the relaxed energy. `DenseRealization.nonempty_approximatingSequence`
supplies a convergent test sequence without imposing an energy bound.

The first step uses the definition of relaxation and the metric description of convergence.
The second uses Mathlib's `mem_closure_iff_seq_limit`. Neither step assumes quadraticity or
agreement of raw and relaxed energy. Keeping these choices here lets the consuming proofs focus
on their different conclusions: lower semicontinuity and convergence of recovery energies.
