# Contraction bounds under sequential relaxation

This module isolates a generic mechanism for transferring an energy bound from concrete tests to
their sequential relaxation. The hypothesis is deliberately stated using the already-relaxed
energy at the transformed test: it does not require the transformation to preserve the concrete
test class.

Continuity of the transformation and lower semicontinuity of the relaxation then extend the bound
to every ambient point. No lattice, truncation, or Markov structure is asserted here.
