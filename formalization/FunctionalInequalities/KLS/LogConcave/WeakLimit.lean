# Weak limits of Poincaré bounds for log-concave laws

Bizeul–Klartag–Lehec arXiv:2610.05474v1, Section 2 (p. 5): a Poincaré inequality that holds along a
weakly convergent sequence of laws with converging constants passes to a log-concave limit law, in
the literature (local-slope) constant. This is the transfer step of the regular approximation; the
approximating laws themselves (Gaussian smoothing and quadratic tilt) are constructed elsewhere.

/-- **Weak-limit transfer of the Poincaré bound** to the literature constant of a log-concave law**
(BKL arXiv:2610.05474v1, Section 2, p. 5): if `μ_j → μ` weakly, each `μ_j` satisfies the smooth-test
Poincaré bound with constant `C_j`, and `C_j → C`, then the log-concave limit `μ` has literature
constant at most `C`. The smooth-test bound passes to the limit on compactly supported smooth tests
(`Poincare.SmoothTest.variance_le_mul_energy_of_tendsto`), extends to all admissible tests by the
cutoff argument (`Poincare.SmoothTest.Holds.of_compactSupport`), and the smooth-test constant equals
the literature constant for log-concave laws. Luna, task S2-W3. -/
