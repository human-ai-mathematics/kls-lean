# Borell representation on the affine support

Source: Blueprint `thm:borell-logconcave-density`, Borell (1974), *Convex measures on locally
convex spaces*, Theorem 1.1 and its finite-dimensional consequences; Bobkov (1999) for the
exponential tail. Read `IsBorellDensity`, then the representative properties, the moment
section, the construction, and finally the intrinsic theorems at the end.

The intrinsic law `ν` of a compact-set log-concave probability `μ` lives on the direction
space `V` of the affine support and is absolutely continuous with respect to every additive
Haar measure `m` on `V`; that part is proved in `KLS/LogConcave/Density/AbsoluteContinuity.lean`.
This module proves the remaining conclusions of the representation theorem:

1. `ν` has a density representative `ρ : V → ℝ` that is Borel, nonnegative, finite-valued,
   upper semicontinuous and log-concave, with `ν = ρ · m` (`IsBorellDensity`,
   `LogConcave.exists_isBorellDensity`);
2. every such representative is positive and continuous on the interior `Ω` of the support of
   `ν` and is bounded above and below by positive constants on every compact subset of `Ω`
   (`IsBorellDensity.pos_of_mem_interior_support`, `IsBorellDensity.continuousOn_interior_support`,
   `IsBorellDensity.exists_bounds_of_isCompact`);
3. `ν` has an exponential moment, hence finite moments of every order
   (`LogConcave.intrinsic_integrable_exp_norm`, `LogConcave.intrinsic_integrable_norm_pow`).

Proof routes. The representative is the upper semicontinuous envelope of the lower density
`liminf ν(B(x, rₙ)) / m(B(0, rₙ))` along `rₙ = 1/(n+1)`: the lower density is log-concave
because equal-radius ball masses are, it is bounded by the proved small-ball estimate, and it
equals the Radon--Nikodym derivative almost everywhere by the Besicovitch differentiation
theorem; the envelope changes it only on the Haar-null frontier of its convex positivity set.
Positivity and the compact bounds use that a convex set with empty interior is Haar-null and that
the logarithm of a log-concave function is concave, hence continuous, on the open interior of the
positivity set. The exponential moment is Borell's lemma applied through the proved Borel-set
formulation: once a ball of radius `R` carries mass `3/4`, the mass outside radius `k R` is at
most `3^{(1-k)/2}`, and the exponential is dominated by a geometric series.

Quantities: `Ω` is `interior ν.support`. The Blueprint writes `Ω` as the interior of the closed
convex hull of the topological support; the two descriptions coincide because the support of a
log-concave law is closed and convex, and `closure_convexHull_intrinsic_support` proves this.
`ν (Ωᶜ) = 0` is `intrinsic_interior_support_compl`.

Reference measures are arbitrary additive Haar measures, so the theorem includes the
zero-dimensional direction space, where every Haar measure is a positive multiple of the Dirac
mass and `ρ` is a positive constant. Nothing here assumes a positive dimension, a density, a
second moment or full-dimensional ambient support. Pointwise bounds on compact subsets are
stronger than the `L^∞_loc` phrasing of the Blueprint and imply it. No Poincaré, Cheeger,
Dirichlet or KLS statement is asserted here.
