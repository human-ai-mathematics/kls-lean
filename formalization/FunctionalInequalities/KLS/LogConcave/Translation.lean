# Log-concave laws under ambient translation

Source: Blueprint `lem:affine-poincare-translation-invariance`, the sentences "`(τ_b)_# μ` is
log-concave" and "translating by the negative barycenter produces a centered law". Read
`LogConcave.translateLaw`, `LogConcave.memLp_id_two`, `LogConcave.integrable_id` and
`LogConcave.integral_id_translateLaw_neg_integral`.

For a compact-set log-concave law `μ` on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space `E` and `b ∈ E`, the
translated law `Probability.translateLaw μ b` is log-concave: the inverse translation is an
affine isometry carrying the translated law back to `μ`, and images of compact sets are the exact
test sets. The ambient law has a finite second moment, because the intrinsic law has one and
reconstruction is an affine isometry; hence its barycenter exists and translating by the negative
barycenter gives a law with zero mean. The affine covariance Poincaré constant itself is
translation invariant for every Borel law, see
`Poincare.CovarianceGradient.Intrinsic.constant_translateLaw`;
log-concavity is not needed for that identity.

What this module does not claim: any Poincaré inequality, finiteness of the constant, the
isotropic reduction, or KLS. The zero-dimensional direction space is included.
