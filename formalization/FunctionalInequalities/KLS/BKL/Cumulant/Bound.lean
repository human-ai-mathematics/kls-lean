# BKL Theorem 4.1 and the cutoff (95), closed

The proved compact Letwin bound `LogConcave.Suspension.letwinCompactBound` discharges the explicit
hypothesis of the shared
producers `cutoffEnergyClaim_of_letwinCompact` and `cumulantBound_of_letwinCompact`
(`Induction.lean`), at `K = 153` for every
order `d + 1 ≥ 2`. These closed endpoints are consumed by the certificates of
`lem:bkl-cutoff-energy` and
`thm:bkl-cumulant-bound` and by the final Poincaré assembly. The uncut Eldan process and the literal
(68)–(73) are not
constructed.
