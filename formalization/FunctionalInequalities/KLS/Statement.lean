# The KLS conjecture as a Lean proposition

Source: Blueprint `conj:kls`, in its covariance-normalized literature formulation.
One finite nonnegative constant is chosen before every dimension and every probability law.
The target includes dimension zero, singular affine supports, and a finite second moment.
It uses the literature local-slope constant, not an arbitrary supplied energy.

This file defines a proposition. It contains no proof of KLS and no assertion of equivalence
with the isotropic formulation. The affine/isotropic equivalence is proved separately in
`KLS/LogConcave/Isotropic.lean`, and the selected/literature bridge in
`KLS/LogConcave/Poincare.lean`; neither supplies a dimension-free bound. This declaration is
versioned with its definitions, not API-frozen.

/-- One finite nonnegative constant bounds the intrinsic local-slope Poincaré constant by
`C * ‖Covariance.operator μ‖` for every dimension and every log-concave probability law with
finite second moment. The covariance is centered. Dimension zero and singular affine supports
are included; no isotropic normalization is imposed on the input law. -/
