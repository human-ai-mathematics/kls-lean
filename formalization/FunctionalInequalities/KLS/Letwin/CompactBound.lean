# The compact Letwin constant-eight bound

`KLS.LogConcave.Suspension.letwinCompactBound : LetwinCompactBound`: for every `n > 0`, every compactly supported isotropic
log-concave probability law on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` and every self-adjoint real operator (singular and indefinite included), the
variance of the quadratic form is at most `8` times its squared Hilbert–Schmidt norm. It follows from the regular-class bound through the
existing compact reduction `letwinCompactBound_of_regularClass`.

This is the exact compact counterpart of Letwin (arXiv:2607.24164v1), Theorem 1.2, as used by Bizeul–Klartag–Lehec
(arXiv:2610.05474v1), Lemma 4.2. It does not state the noncompact theorem; this module provides only that compact
bound.
