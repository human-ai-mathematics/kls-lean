# Poincaré constants before and after relaxation

These two proved comparisons belong to `lem:legacy-relaxed-poincare-comparison`. The definition
assigns to each concrete test the variance of its `L²` realization and its original finite energy.

The equivalence uses continuity of `L²` variance and the definition of sequential
relaxation. It does not need density, quadraticity, a Markov property, or agreement of raw and
relaxed energy. In particular it includes an empty test type and an infinite optimal constant.

Source: local abstract formulation of Blueprint `thm:legacy-relaxed-holds-equivalence`.
The Euclidean specialization is in `Poincare.SmoothTest.Comparison`; these statements
are not claimed as a separate theorem in the cited KLS literature.
